     * 
     * @param hifiAuthJWT  This JSON Web Token (JWT) is used by callers to associate a user with a specific High Fidelity Spatial Audio API Server.
     * JWTs are an industry-standard method for securely representing claims between two applications.
     * 
     * **Important information about JWTs:**
     * - **Do not expose JWTs to users!** Anyone with access to one of your JWTs will be able to connect to your High Fidelity Spatial Audio API Server.
     * - In your application's production environment, each client running your app code should connect to the High Fidelity Spatial Audio Server with a unique JWT.
     * In the case of a Web application, your application server code should generate a JWT associated with the user requesting your Web application.
     * 
     * To generate a JWT for use with the High Fidelity Audio API:
     * 1. Head to {@link https://jwt.io/} to find the appropriate library for your langauge.
     *     a. For NodeJS applications and Web applications compilied from NodeJS code, we recommend {@link https://www.npmjs.com/package/jose|jose}.
     * 2. Using the {@link https://account.highfidelity.com/dev/account|High Fidelity Audio API Developer Console},
     * obtain your App ID, Space ID, and App Secret.
     * 3. Create your user's JWT using the appropriate library, passing your App ID, Space ID, and App Secret. Here is an example of what that might look like, using NodeJS and `jose`:
     *     ```
     * hiFiSampleJWT = await new SignJWT({
     *     "app_id": APP_ID,
     *     "space_id": SPACE_ID
     * })
     * .setProtectedHeader({ alg: 'HS256', typ: 'JWT' })
     * .sign(crypto.createSecretKey(Buffer.from(APP_SECRET, "utf8")));
     *     ```
     * Please reference our {@link https://www.highfidelity.com/api/guides/misc/getAJWT|"Get a JWT" guide} for additional context.
     * 4. Pass the created JWT to `connectToHiFiAudioAPIServer()`.
     * 
     * @param signalingHostURL An URL that will be used to create a valid WebRTC signaling address at High Fidelity. The passed `signalingHostURL` parameter should not contain the protocol
     * or port - e.g. `server.highfidelity.com` - and it will be used to construct a signaling address of the form: `wss://${signalingHostURL}:${signalingPort}/?token=`
