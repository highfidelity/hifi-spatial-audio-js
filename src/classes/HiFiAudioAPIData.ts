     * This value affects how far a user's sound will travel in 3D space, without affecting the user's loudness.
     * By default, there is a global attenuation value (set for a given space) that applies to all users in a space. This default space
     * attenuation is usually 0.5, which represents a reasonable approximation of a real-world fall-off in sound over distance.
     * Lower numbers represent less attenuation (i.e. sound travels farther); higher numbers represent more attenuation (i.e. sound drops
     * off more quickly).
     * 
     * When setting this value for an individual user, the following holds:
     *   - Positive numbers should be between 0 and 1, and they represent a logarithmic attenuation. This range is recommended, as it is
     * more natural sounding.  Smaller numbers represent less attenuation, so a number such as 0.2 can be used to make a particular 
     * user's audio travel farther than other users', for instance in "amplified" concert type settings. Similarly, an extremely 
     * small non-zero number (e.g. 0.00001) can be used to effectively turn off attenuation for a given user within a reasonably 
     * sized space, resulting in a "broadcast mode" where the user can be heard throughout most of the space regardless of their location
     * relative to other users. (Note: The actual value "0" is used internally to represent the default; for setting minimal attenuation, 
     * small non-zero numbers should be used instead. See also "userRolloff" below.)
     *   - Negative attenuation numbers are used to represent linear attenuation, and are a somewhat artificial, non-real-world concept. However,
     * this setting can be used as a blunt tool to easily test attenuation, and tune it aggressively in extreme circumstances. When using linear 
     * attenuation, the setting is the distance in meters at which the audio becomes totally inaudible.
     *
     * If you don't supply an `userAttenuation` when constructing instantiations of this class, `userAttenuation` will be `null` and the
     * default will be used.

     * meters, which applies to all users in a space. This value represents the distance for a 1kHz rolloff. Values in the range of 
     * 12 to 32 meters provide a more "enclosed" sound, in which high frequencies tend to be dampened over distance as they are 
     * in the real world. Generally changes to roll-off values should be made for the entire space rather than for individual users, but
     * extremely high values (e.g. 99999) should be used in combination with "broadcast mode"-style userAttenuation settings to cause the
